Communication Flow for my Project
My project sends a request to partner's microservice. For instance, this 
could be to set or check a stock price alert.

Partner's micrservice processes the incoming request, performs the necesssary 
actions such as setting up a stock price alert. 

After processing the request, your partner's microservice sends the response back to your individual 
project. This response could be a confirmation of the alert setup, a stock
price update, etc.

Communication Flow for Partner's Project
Partner's project sends a request to my microservice, which is getting a random League of Legends champion
name.

My microservice handles the request, selecting a random champion name from the list or through any other 
logic you've implemented.

My microservice then sends back the response to your partner's project, such as the name of a 
randomly selected champion.
